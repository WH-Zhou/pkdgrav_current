Basic tests of the code featuring rubble pile collisions.

Procedure:

1. Enter the run directory of your choice and copy the Makefile.in
   file there to the source root (make a copy of the original first!).
   The run directories are described below.

2. Compile the code then copy the executable (from the bin
   subdirectory) to the run directory.

3. Run the simulation in the run directory with "./pkdgrav ss.par".
   When done, use "mkmov.py" to generate a movie to compare with
   expected.mp4 in the directory.

Run directories:

1. hard_sphere: collides 2 rubble piles using the hard-sphere version
   of the code.  Compare with soft_sphere.  Note an overlap warning is
   expected.

2. hard_sphere_aggs: in this version the "rubble piles" are frozen
   into solid aggregates.  Compare with soft_sphere_aggs.

3. soft_sphere: collides 2 rubble piles using the soft-sphere version
   of the code.  Compared with hard_sphere (which finishes sooner),
   there is greater energy transmission along the collision axis,
   because soft sphere does a better job at simulating the "Newton's
   Cradle" effect.  Note this scenario is precisely the same as the
   example in the soft-sphere tutorial (in docs/SSDEM_tutorial.pdf).

4. soft_sphere_aggs: in this version the "rubble piles" are frozen
   into solid aggregates.  Compared with hard_sphere_aggs, the
   collision outcome maintains symmetry, whereas the hard-sphere
   version exhibits rotation, because hard sphere treats collisions
   one particle pair at a time and therefore cannot simulate
   simultaneous impacts between multiple pairs.

Possible future updates:

1. Run with TRACK_ORIENT on.

2. Consider running rpa.py for comparisons.

3. Confirm using optimal parameters via demparams.
