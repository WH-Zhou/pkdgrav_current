Current best estimates for DEM parameters:

Kinetic dKn = 4.601135e+14 kg/s^2 = 5.835393e-03 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2 (recommended)
Static dKn  = 3.569931e+09 kg/s^2 = 4.527567e-08 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2
Cohesion dKn  = 0.000000e+00 kg/s^2 = 0.000000e+00 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2
dDelta (for recommended dKn) = 9.436757e-03 s = 1.878896e-09 yr/2pi
dCohesiveCoeff = 0.000000e+00 Pa = 0.000000e+00 M_Sun/AU/(yr/2pi)^2
