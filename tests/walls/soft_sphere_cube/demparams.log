Current best estimates for DEM parameters:

Kinetic dKn = 5.087835e+07 kg/s^2 = 6.452650e-10 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2 (recommended)
Static dKn  = 3.782631e+04 kg/s^2 = 4.797325e-13 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2
Cohesion dKn  = 0.000000e+00 kg/s^2 = 0.000000e+00 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2
dDelta (for recommended dKn) = 4.936537e-06 s = 9.828843e-13 yr/2pi
dCohesiveCoeff = 0.000000e+00 Pa = 0.000000e+00 M_Sun/AU/(yr/2pi)^2
