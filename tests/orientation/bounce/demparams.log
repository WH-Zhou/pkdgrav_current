Current best estimates for DEM parameters:

Kinetic dKn = 8.377580e+01 kg/s^2 = 1.062487e-15 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2
Static dKn  = 1.274000e+04 kg/s^2 = 1.615751e-13 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2 (recommended)
Cohesion dKn  = 0.000000e+00 kg/s^2 = 0.000000e+00 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2
dDelta (for recommended dKn) = 6.004657e-05 s = 1.195551e-11 yr/2pi
dCohesiveCoeff = 0.000000e+00 Pa = 0.000000e+00 M_Sun/AU/(yr/2pi)^2

NOTE: Typical overlap duration  = 0.0018014 s
      Typical propagation speed = 11.1025 m/s
      Particle dynamical time = 2737.52 s (number of timesteps = 45589915)
      Bulk dynamical time = 3395.47 s (number of timesteps = 56547330)
      Cohesive force = 0.000000e+00 N = 0.0000 particle's weight (assume beta_s = 0.5)
