Simple tests of particle orientation tracking.

Procedure:

1. Copy Makefile.in to the source root (make a copy of the original
   first!), compile the code, then copy the executable (from the bin
   subdirectory) to the desired run directory (described below).  Note
   the same executable can be used for each test.

3. Run the simulation in the run directory with "./pkdgrav ss.par".
   Instructions for making plots and movies for comparison are given
   in the run directory descriptions.  Note movie generation requires
   POV-Ray to be installed.  The Python scripts require Python 3.X
   with NumPy and Matplotlib.

Run directories:

1. bounce: 2 particles collide in free space, 1 particle spinning.
   Make movie with "mkmov.py -o" and compare with expected.mp4.  Run
   "python spins.py" and compare with particle0.png & particle1.png.

2. cylinder: 20 particles fill a cylinder.  Make movie with "mkmov.py
   -o -r 90" and compare with expected.mp4 -- note this movie takes a
   while to build!

3. roll: 1 particle rolls to a stop.  Make movie with "mkmov.py -o -r
   90" and compare with expected.mp4.  Run "python roll.py" and
   compare with rollplot.png
