Current best estimates for DEM parameters:

Kinetic dKn = 1.642006e+06 kg/s^2 = 2.082475e-11 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2 (recommended)
Static dKn  = 1.274000e+03 kg/s^2 = 1.615751e-14 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2
Cohesion dKn  = 0.000000e+00 kg/s^2 = 0.000000e+00 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2
dDelta (for recommended dKn) = 5.289146e-06 s = 1.053090e-12 yr/2pi
dCohesiveCoeff = 0.000000e+00 Pa = 0.000000e+00 M_Sun/AU/(yr/2pi)^2
