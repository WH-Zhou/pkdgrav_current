Current best estimates for DEM parameters:

Kinetic dKn = 2.020492e+06 kg/s^2 = 2.562490e-11 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2 (recommended)
Static dKn  = 7.874261e+01 kg/s^2 = 9.986537e-16 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2
Cohesion dKn  = 0.000000e+00 kg/s^2 = 0.000000e+00 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2
dDelta (for recommended dKn) = 2.477574e-02 s = 4.932949e-09 yr/2pi
dCohesiveCoeff = 0.000000e+00 Pa = 0.000000e+00 M_Sun/AU/(yr/2pi)^2
