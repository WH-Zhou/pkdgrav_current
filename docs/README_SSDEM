DCR 6/7/18: currently bUseLegacyRoll and bUseContactRadius can be set
regardless of whether DEM_ROTATION_DASHPOT is defined, even though
they're really intended to modify the behavior of the dashpot.  This
needs to be cleaned up in a future update, but for now the parameters
remain in the "DEM_ROTATION_DASHPOT"-only section of ss.par, even
though they can be used without that option.  See email exchange with
Steve and Yun 6/5-6/7.  Note that the friction strength will be
affected by activating these functions since the contact area used to
calculate the friction resistance is changed.
