Some of the Python scripts in bin/scripts use the subprocess module, which
in turn may access the system Bourne shell.  In some versions of Ubuntu,
/bin/sh is actually a soft link to /bin/dash and results in a script error
"sh: Syntax error: Bad fd number".  A workaround is to see if "ls -l /bin/sh"
is a softlink to /bin/dash, and if so change it to /bin/bash:

sudo mv /bin/sh /bin/sh.orig                                                    
sudo ln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh

(An alternative may be to use "dpkg-reconfigure dash" instead, and choose no
when asked if you want dash as your default system shell.)
