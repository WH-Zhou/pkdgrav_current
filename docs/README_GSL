The public release of this code uses the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL) for
several numerical operations. It is up to the user to ensure GSL has been
installed properly (visit https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).

To compile the code, edit METHOD_CFLAGS and METHOD_LDFLAGS in Makefile.in
to reflect the correct paths to the GSL include files and library files,
respectively.
