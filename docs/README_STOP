While running, pkdgrav looks to see whether a file called "STOP" is
present in the run directory.  If so, and if the file is empty, a
"clean" stop will occur, shutting down all threads and writing an
output at the current step, and, if applicable a checkpoint (or
equivalent).

You can also provide a specific instruction to pkdgrav via the STOP
file.  The following commands are recognized if present in the file
(not case sensitive):

none   -- do nothing
stop   -- stop the run (same as giving an empty STOP file)
status -- reports current step, sim time, and particle number
check  -- writes a checkpoint
output -- writes output for the current step

Once processed, the STOP file is automatically deleted.

HINTS:

1. To quickly and cleanly stop a pkdgrav run, just type "touch STOP".

2. Otherwise to issue one of the above commands, just type, "echo
   COMMAND > STOP", where "COMMAND" is one of the valid commands.

DEVELOPERS:

The functionality is implemented in master.c:msrCheckForInterrupt(),
which is called during the top-level simulation loop in main.c:main().
The interrupts are defined in master.h (search for "interrupt").
