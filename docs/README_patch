Note about particle spins in the SLIDING_PATCH scheme:

Zero spin in space (ss file) implies spin of -omega z-hat in patch frame.

To make particles have zero spin in the patch frame, set their spins
in the ss file to +omega z-hat.

In a dense ring environment (lots of collisions per particle per
orbit) this may not be important, because the system will quickly
reach a new equilibrium and memory of the original spins will be lost.

This needs to be checked/documented properly.

For more about SLIDING_PATCH, also see README_vPred in this directory.
